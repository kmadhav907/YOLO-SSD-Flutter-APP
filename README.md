Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free
and open source.

## About Flutter

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model.

### Beautiful user experiences

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's [layered architecture] gives you control over every pixel on the
screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
[set of widgets][widget catalog] that deliver pixel-perfect experiences on both
iOS and Android.

### Fast results

Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
library that underpins Chrome and Android: [Skia]. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class [Dart platform], which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, as well
as JavaScript for the web and Intel x64 for desktop devices.

### Productive development

Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.

### Extensible and open model

Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all) but includes editor
plug-ins for both [Visual Studio Code] and [IntelliJ / Android Studio]. Flutter
provides [thousands of packages][Flutter packages] to speed your development,
regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code is easy,
with support for both [FFI] and [platform-specific APIs][platform channels].

Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found at our
[contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Awesome TensorFlow Lite [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) [![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitter-%40margaretmz-blue)](https://twitter.com/margaretmz)
[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) is a set of tools that help convert and optimize TensorFlow models to run on mobile and edge devices. It's currently running on more than 4 billion devices! With TensorFlow 2.x, you can train a model with tf.Keras, easily convert a model to .tflite and deploy it; or you can download a pretrained TensorFlow Lite model from the model zoo.

This is an awesome list of TensorFlow Lite models with sample apps, helpful tools and learning resources -
* Showcase what the community has built with TensorFlow Lite 
* Put all the samples side-by-side for easy reference
* Share knowledge and learning resources

Please submit a PR if you would like to contribute and follow the guidelines [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
